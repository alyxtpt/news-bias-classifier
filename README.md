# news-bias-classifier
This is a small machine learning project that classifies political bias in news text.
The system uses a TF-IDF text representation and a logistic regression classifier trained on manually labeled news excerpts.
I added a simple Streamlit web interface where you can paste an article and see the predicted label and probability distribution.
