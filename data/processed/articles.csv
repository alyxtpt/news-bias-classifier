"""A moderate House Republican is raging against his own party after negotiations over a vote on extending COVID-19-era Obamacare subsidies fell apart. Rep. Mike Lawler, R-N.Y., told reporters Tuesday morning that it was ""idiotic"" and ""political malpractice"" to not hold an ""up-or-down vote"" on the subsidies, which are set to expire at the end of this year. He also turned his ire on House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., who he accused of rejecting moderate Republicans' compromise solutions in order to keep the issue alive as a political cudgel.""",Right
"""The House won't vote this week on an extension to the Affordable Care Act's enhanced premium subsidies, which lapse at the end of the year. An 11th-hour effort by moderate Republicans to put an extension on the floor for a vote failed Tuesday night, when the House Rules Committee blocked several of the amendments they were seeking to the attach to a GOP health care plan released last week. The GOP plan does not include an extension. The committee advanced the bill to the floor late Tuesday. A vote is expected Wednesday.""",Left

"""On the morning of November 4, 2025, an off-year Election Day, White House chief of staff Susie Wiles was meeting in the Oval Office with the president and his top advisers, men she calls her ""core team"": Vice President JD Vance, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, and Stephen Miller, deputy chief of staff. The agenda was twofold: ending the congressional filibuster and forcing Venezuelan president Nicolás Maduro from power. As she related it later, President Donald Trump was holding forth on the filibuster when Wiles stood up and started for the door. Trump eyed her. ""Is this an emergency, that you have to leave?"" he demanded. It was nothing of the sort—but Wiles left Trump guessing. She replied: ""It's an emergency. It doesn't involve you."" With that, according to Wiles, she departed the Oval.""",Left
